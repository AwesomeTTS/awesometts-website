# AwesomeTTS website

AwesomeTTS makes it easy for language-learners and other students to add
speech to their personal [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) card decks.

The website provides documentation and help for current and prospective users
of AwesomeTTS, in addition to hosting some limited APIs for use from the
add-on (e.g. update mechanism, relay access to some third-party APIs).
